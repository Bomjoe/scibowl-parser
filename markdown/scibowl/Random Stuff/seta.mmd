21) Earth and Space Science Multiple Choice Approximately where on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram would Sirius B be found?  

text[[125, 150, 255, 234]]
W) Top Left 
X) Bottom Left 
Y) Top Right 
Z) Bottom Right  

text[[115, 240, 348, 256]]
ANSWER: X) BOTTOM LEFT  

text[[115, 263, 882, 310]]
(Notes: Sirius B is a white dwarf. White dwarfs have high surface temperatures and absolute magnitudes, as they are nearing the end of their stellar lives. As a result, they would be in the bottom left corner of the H-R diagram.)
