24) Physics - Short Answer A solenoid has a magnetic field given by \(B = 4\mu_{0}(x^{2} + y^{2})\) [four mu zero open parentheses x squared plus y squared close parentheses] and a volume magnetic susceptibility, \(X\) where \(X = 10\) . At the point \((2,3)\) , what is the magnetization inside of the solenoid?
