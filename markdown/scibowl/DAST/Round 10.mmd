X) Nitration of toluene strongly favors the para form because the intermediate has a resonance structure that exhibits a negative charge adjacent to the methyl group 
Y) Nitration of toluene strongly favors the meta form because the intermediate has a resonance structure that exhibits a positive charge adjacent to the methyl group 
Z) Nitration of toluene strongly favors the meta form because the intermediate has a resonance structure that exhibits a negative charge adjacent to the methyl group
