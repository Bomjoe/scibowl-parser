22) PHYSICS Short Answer Yash creates a solar system model consisting of a massless spring with rest length zero fixed at one end and attached to a marble on the other end. The marble moves without friction. Due to the difference between the spring force and gravity, this is not a perfect simulation of the solar system. By name or number, identify all of the following four statements about this system which are generally true:  

text[[168, 523, 851, 595]]
1) The marble moves in an ellipse 
2) The spring sweeps out area at a constant rate 
3) The square of the marble's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse
