3) Math – Short Answer Ignore the image, I just want to make it a visual bonus to give you more time. Matt and Shoe are playing a game. Matt secretly chooses an integer from 0 to 99 inclusive. Every turn, Shoe guesses an integer, and Matt tells her whether the sum of her integer's digits is greater than, less than, or equal to the sum of Matt's integer's digits. If Shoe guesses optimally, what is the minimum number of turns she needs to guarantee that she eventually guesses Matt's integer?
