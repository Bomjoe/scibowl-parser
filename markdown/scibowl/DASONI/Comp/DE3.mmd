7) BIOLOGY Short Answer Phoenixes have a colorless pigment in their feathers that can either be converted to a red pigment or a blue pigment, and they have two genes that regulate this. Phoenixes with at least one copy of the dominant W [big W] allele produce an enzyme that inhibits the conversion of the colorless pigment precursor to any colored pigment, while phoenixes with the ww [little w little w] phenotype do not produce this enzyme, which allows an enzyme naturally in their feathers to convert the colorless pigment to a blue pigment.
