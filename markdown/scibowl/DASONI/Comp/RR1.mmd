23) PHYSICS Short Answer Arnesh calculates the Reynolds number of a mystery liquid by pumping it through a pipe, but his numbers are a little bit off. If the pipe had 4 times the cross-sectional area as he thought it had and the liquid was moving a quarter as fast as measured, by what factor should Arnesh multiply his Reynolds number to get the correct value?
