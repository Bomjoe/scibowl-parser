1) BIOLOGY Short Answer Van Valen's law states that the probability of extinction for a species is constant over time. Because this appears to contradict the idea that species will continually become better adapted to their environment and thus have a lower probability of extinction, it is explained by what hypothesis that states that species are in constant competition, which has the net effect of preventing a long-term gain in fitness?
