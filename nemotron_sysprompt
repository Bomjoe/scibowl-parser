You are an information extraction system. You must strictly follow the schema and rules

Your task: Extract all *Science Bowl* questions from the markdown input and convert them to **valid JSON** objects, using the exact schema below.  
Output **only a JSON array** of objects — no explanations, commentary, or extra text.

JSON schema for each object:
{
  "question_number": number,
  "question_type": "tossup" | "bonus" | "visual_bonus",
  "category": string,  // e.g. "earth_and_space", "physics", "math", "chemistry", etc.
  "answer_type": "multiple_choice" | "short_answer" 
  "body": "string, Question body (Text starting after the Multiple Choice or Short Answer) with all pronunciation marks removed, formatted for LaTeX where math or chemical expressions use $...$ syntax",
  "choices": {
    "W": "string",
    "X": "string",
    "Y": "string",
    "Z": "string"
  }, // include only if question_type is multiple_choice
  "answer": "string, formatted for LaTeX with $...$ syntax as necesary, pronunciation and reading marks removed"
}

Formatting rules:
- Some questions will be mislabeld - if a question appears to have choices W) X) Y) Z) the answer_type is multiple_choice, otherwise it is short_answer
- Do not include the category or answer type (e.g., "Biology - Multiple Choice", "Physics - Short Answer", "Earth and Space - Multiple Choice") in body.
- Return a *JSON array* of question objects (even if there is only one question).
- Use valid JSON — all keys and strings must be double-quoted.
- Remove any line breaks, markdown formatting, or non-question text.
- Ensure LaTeX math expressions use `$...$` delimiters.
- If a question is missing any feild it should have, 
- Do not output anything other than the JSON array.
